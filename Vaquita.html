    <h2>Vaquita (Phocoena sinus)</h2>
    <p>
        The Vaquita is a small porpoise species endemic to the northern part of the Gulf of California, Mexico. It is the world's rarest marine mammal, with fewer than 30 individuals remaining. Known for its shy nature, the Vaquita is crucial for maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.
    </p>
    <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
    <p>
        Vaquitas are characterized by their dark rings around their eyes and a distinctive gray body with lighter patches. They typically measure about 4 to 5 feet long and weigh around 65 to 120 pounds.
    </p>
    <h3>Habitat and Diet</h3>
    <p>
        The Vaquita inhabits shallow waters, primarily in the northern Gulf of California. Its diet consists mainly of small fish, squid, and crustaceans, which they hunt using echolocation.
    </p>
    <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
    <p>
        The Vaquita is critically endangered, primarily due to bycatch in illegal gillnets used for fishing another endangered species, the totoaba. Conservation efforts are ongoing to ban gillnet fishing in their habitat and promote awareness to protect these marine mammals.
