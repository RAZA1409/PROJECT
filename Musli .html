        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Musli, scientifically known as <em>Chlorophytum borivilianum</em>, is a herbaceous plant used extensively in Ayurvedic, Unani, and traditional Indian medicine. It is valued for its medicinal roots, which are used as an aphrodisiac, rejuvenator, and tonic for strengthening the immune system.</p>

        <h2>Medicinal Properties</h2>
        <p>The roots of Musli are rich in bioactive compounds, including saponins, which are believed to have various therapeutic effects. Musli is known for improving vitality, boosting energy, enhancing physical strength, and supporting sexual health.

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>Musli is native to India and grows primarily in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soil, under partial shade, making it difficult to cultivate on a large scale. The increasing demand for Musli has led to overharvesting, which threatens its wild populations.</p>
        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>Musli is categorized as a <strong>Vulnerable</strong> species due to overharvesting for medicinal purposes and habitat destruction. Conservation efforts are focused on promoting sustainable cultivation practices and regulating the harvesting of wild Musli.
