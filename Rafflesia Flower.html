        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Rafflesia Flower, known scientifically as <em>Rafflesia arnoldii</em>, is one of the most extraordinary flowers in the world. It holds the title of being the largest flower, with some specimens reaching over 3 feet in diameter. Despite its beauty, the flower emits a foul odor, earning it the nickname "corpse flower."</p>

        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Rafflesia is a parasitic plant, lacking leaves, stems, and roots. It grows inside a host vine, emerging only when it's ready to bloom. The bloom itself lasts for just a few days before wilting. The flower’s odor, resembling decaying flesh, attracts carrion flies that aid in its pollination.</p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>This rare flower is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, specifically in parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, low-lying forests, but deforestation and habitat destruction pose serious threats to its survival.</p>
        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>The Rafflesia is currently listed as <strong>Endangered</strong>. The destruction of rainforests and over-collection have drastically reduced its population. Conservation efforts are focused on protecting its natural habitat and supporting sustainable tourism that helps raise awareness about this unique species.</p>
