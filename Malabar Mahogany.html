        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Malabar Mahogany, scientifically known as <em>Swietenia mahagoni</em>, is a valuable hardwood species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is known for its fine-grained wood, which is prized in the furniture industry for its durability, attractive appearance, and resistance to pests.</p>

        <h2>Uses and Importance</h2>
        <p>The high-quality timber from Malabar Mahogany is used for making furniture, cabinetry, and even musical instruments. Its reddish-brown wood is highly durable and resistant to termites, making it a popular choice for long-lasting furniture. Additionally, the tree has medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine to treat various ailments.</p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>Malabar Mahogany is primarily found in the tropical rainforests of the Western Ghats, where it thrives in well-drained soil with high humidity. However, deforestation, illegal logging, and habitat destruction have significantly reduced its population, making it harder to find mature trees in the wild.</p>
        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>Malabar Mahogany is considered a <strong>Vulnerable</strong> species due to over-exploitation for its valuable timber. Conservation efforts are focused on sustainable logging practices, reforestation projects, and the enforcement of stricter laws to prevent illegal logging. Efforts are also being made to promote the planting of Malabar Mahogany in protected areas to ensure its survival.</p>
