        <h2>Snow Leopard (Panthera uncia)</h2>
        <p>
            The Snow Leopard is a large cat native to the mountain ranges of Central and South Asia. Known for its beautiful, thick fur and elusive nature, the snow leopard is considered one of the most elusive big cats in the world. It is listed as "Vulnerable" on the IUCN Red List due to habitat loss and poaching.
        </p>
        <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
        <p>
            Snow leopards have thick, smoky-gray fur with black rosettes and spots that provide perfect camouflage in the rocky, mountainous terrain they inhabit. They have long, bushy tails that help them maintain balance while navigating steep slopes.
        </p>
        <h3>Habitat and Diet</h3>
        <p>
            Snow leopards are found in the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions. Their diet primarily consists of blue sheep, mountain ibex, and other smaller mammals.
        </p>
        <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
        <p>
            Snow leopards are threatened by habitat loss, poaching for their pelts and bones, and the decline of their prey. Conservation efforts focus on reducing human-wildlife conflict and preserving their natural habitat.
