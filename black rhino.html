        <h2>Black Rhino (Diceros bicornis)</h2>
        <p>
            The Black Rhino is critically endangered, known for its two horns on the skull and a hooked upper lip. It is native to the eastern and southern parts of Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.
        </p>
        <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
        <p>
            Black Rhinos are smaller than their white rhino cousins, weighing between 1,800 to 3,100 pounds (800 to 1,400 kg). They have a pointed prehensile upper lip that helps them grasp leaves and branches from shrubs and trees.
        </p>
        <h3>Habitat and Diet</h3>
        <p>
            Black Rhinos inhabit grasslands, savannas, and tropical bushlands. Their diet consists of leafy plants, branches, shoots, thorny bushes, and fruit. They are browsers rather than grazers.
        </p>
        <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
        <p>
            Once widespread across sub-Saharan Africa, Black Rhino numbers have dramatically decreased due to poaching for their horns. Despite conservation efforts, fewer than 5,500 remain in the wild today, classifying them as "Critically Endangered."
