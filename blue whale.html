    <h2>Blue Whale (Balaenoptera musculus)</h2>
    <p>
        The Blue Whale is the largest animal ever known to have lived on Earth. These majestic creatures can reach lengths of up to 100 feet and weigh as much as 200 tons. Blue Whales are found in oceans around the world, from the Arctic to the Southern Ocean.
    </p>
    <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
    <p>
        Blue Whales have long, streamlined bodies with a bluish-grey coloration. Their heart alone can weigh as much as an automobile, and their tongues can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their size, their primary diet consists of tiny shrimp-like animals called krill.
    </p>
    <h3>Habitat and Diet</h3>
    <p>
        Blue Whales are found in all the world's oceans except the Arctic. They primarily feed in cold, productive waters, consuming up to 4 tons of krill each day during feeding seasons. They migrate thousands of miles to breed in warmer waters.
    </p>
    <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
    <p>
        Blue Whales are classified as "Endangered" by the IUCN. Due to decades of whaling in the 20th century, their population was drastically reduced. Although hunting has ceased, Blue Whales face threats from ship strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, and climate change.
