        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Arizona Agave, scientifically known as <em>Agave arizonica</em>, is a rare succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its sharp spines and thick, fleshy leaves that form rosettes. This hardy plant is well-adapted to arid environments, making it an iconic species in the desert regions of Arizona and New Mexico.</p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Arizona Agave plants are relatively small compared to other agave species, with rosettes measuring about 30-40 cm in diameter. The leaves are blue-green in color, and they possess sharp spines along the edges. Arizona Agave is known for its ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions, relying on stored water in its fleshy leaves.</p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>The Arizona Agave grows in rocky, desert areas at elevations of 1,200 to 1,800 meters. It is found in small populations in the mountainous regions of central Arizona. Its habitat consists of well-drained soils with little organic matter, often in crevices of rock outcrops where other vegetation struggles to survive.</p>
    
        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>Arizona Agave is listed as an <strong>Endangered</strong> species due to its restricted range and low population numbers. The primary threats to its survival include habitat destruction from urban development, illegal collection by plant enthusiasts, and climate change. Conservation efforts include habitat protection and restrictions on the collection of wild plants. Research is also underway to support its propagation and reintroduction into protected areas.</p>
