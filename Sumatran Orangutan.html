        <h2>Sumatran Orangutan (Pongo abelii)</h2>
        <p>
            The Sumatran Orangutan is a critically endangered species of great ape found only on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Known for its intelligence and gentle nature, the Sumatran Orangutan is closely related to humans, sharing about 97% of the same DNA. They are highly arboreal, spending most of their time in trees.
        </p>
        <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
        <p>
            Sumatran Orangutans have long, reddish-brown hair, and males develop distinctive cheek pads called flanges. They have long arms that are well-suited for swinging from branch to branch in the rainforest canopy.
        </p>
        <h3>Habitat and Diet</h3>
        <p>
            These orangutans are native to tropical rainforests, particularly in northern Sumatra. Their diet mainly consists of fruit, leaves, and insects, and they play a critical role in seed dispersal, contributing to the health of their ecosystem.
        </p>
        <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
        <p>
            The Sumatran Orangutan is critically endangered due to habitat destruction caused by deforestation, illegal logging, and palm oil plantations. Conservation efforts aim to protect their forest habitat and reduce human-wildlife conflict.
