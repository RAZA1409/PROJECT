    <h2>Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)</h2>
    <p>
        The giant panda, known for its distinctive black-and-white fur, is one of the world's most beloved animals. Native to the mountain ranges of central China, they are primarily found in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces.
    </p>
    <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
    <p>
        Giant pandas have large, round bodies covered in thick white fur with prominent black patches around their eyes, ears, and legs. Adults can weigh up to 330 pounds (150 kg) and grow to about 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8 meters) in length.
    </p>
    <h3>Habitat and Diet</h3>
    <p>
        Giant pandas inhabit bamboo forests in the high-altitude mountains of China. Bamboo makes up over 99% of their diet, and they need to consume around 26 to 84 pounds of bamboo daily to meet their energy needs.
    </p>
    <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
    <p>
        While the giant panda is no longer classified as "Endangered," it remains "Vulnerable" according to the IUCN Red List. Conservation efforts in China have been successful, with about 1,800 individuals now living in the wild.
