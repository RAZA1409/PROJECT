        <h2>Sea Turtle (Cheloniidae and Dermochelyidae)</h2>
        <p>
            Sea Turtles are ancient marine reptiles that have been swimming the world's oceans for over 100 million years. There are seven species of sea turtles, six of which are classified as endangered or critically endangered. These species include the Leatherback, Loggerhead, and Green Turtles.
        </p>
        <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
        <p>
            Sea turtles have large, streamlined shells and strong flippers, making them excellent swimmers. They range in size from the smaller Olive Ridley Turtle to the massive Leatherback, which can weigh up to 2,000 pounds.
        </p>
        <h3>Habitat and Diet</h3>
        <p>
            Sea turtles are found in tropical and subtropical waters around the world. They feed on a wide variety of food depending on the species, from sea grass and algae to jellyfish and small invertebrates.
        </p>
        <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
        <p>
            Many species of sea turtles are threatened by habitat loss, poaching, entanglement in fishing gear, and climate change. Conservation efforts focus on protecting nesting sites, reducing bycatch, and ensuring safe migration routes.
